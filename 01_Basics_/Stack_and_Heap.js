/*

//datatypes are based on memory allocation
Primitive datatypes->  call by value (string,number,boolean,null,undefined,BigInt,symbol) ->Stack memory

Reference/Non primitive data types -> call by reference ( array,object, function) -> heap memory

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that you don't need to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it.
